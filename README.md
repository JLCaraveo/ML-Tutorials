# Machine Learning Torotials

Machine Learning Tutorials is a project that has as main goal share my knowledge to others.

Here is explained how to create Machine Learning Algoriths from scratch. Also how to implement it with Sikit-Learn library.

Fundamental maths needed to understand what happened behind the algorithm.

Until now, the topics that have already been cover are:

* Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.
* Logistic Regresion.

The reason way the proect is implemented is because the most information about Machine Learning is in English. The project is trying to translate the knowledge that is alredy in English into Spanish.

All the notebooks releated for each algorithm have the English and Spanish Version.

Fell free to comment if a mistake is presented in the notebook. It will be solved as soon as possible.

Repository under construccion, the algorithms will be added as soon as they are ready to be released.
